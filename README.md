# Welcome to this repository.

This repository is made for me to try and improve my knowledge of GraphQL and React + Typescript. Don't pay too much attention to this, it will probably lead to nothing good, but who knows.

## Technologies I used.

- Apollo client
- React + Typescript
- Tailwindcss
- Vite
- React-router-dom
- Zustand
- HeadlessUI

## Others

## Comments 

- The project will not be very interesting and consists of simple cards, but I do it for sole learning purposes. 

## Known Issues

- No desktop version so the cards stretch all the way.

## Changelog

2023-05-15 - Start of the repository.
